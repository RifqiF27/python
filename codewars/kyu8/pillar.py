# There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

# 1. number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
# 2. distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
# 3. width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
# Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

def pillars(num_pill, dist, width):
    if num_pill == 1:
        return 0
    pillarDist = (num_pill-2) * width
    betweenDist = dist * (num_pill-1) * 100
    return pillarDist + betweenDist


print(pillars(1, 10, 10))
print(pillars(2, 20, 25))
print(pillars(11, 15, 30))
